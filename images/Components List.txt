ESP32 WEB RADIO COMPONENTS LIST

1 x 20-way (2 rows of 10 pins, 2.54mm , 0.1”) IDC female cable to connect the screen to the motherboard

1x 10-way (2 rows of 5 pins) IDC female cable (the same as used in programming the Arduino with an ISP)

The shorter the better!

1 x 470μF capacitor (at least 10v but don’t go mad as they get bigger the higher the voltage) or similar (whatever fits nicely on the board)

1 x 10kΩ resistor SMD or TH your choice

1 x two-pin pushbutton (optional just for “NEXT” testing but mandatory if you don’t have the screen working).

1 x 100nF SMD capacitor (optional, a case of belt-and-braces)

2.5mm (0.1”) pin headers just like on the Arduino, but for the IDC cables to plug into. Total pins approx. 80 pins, very cheap to buy!

2 x 15-way female sockets (2.54mm , 0.1”) for the ESP32 to plug into: https://amzn.to/3axmvsf 

1 x 14-way female socket (2.54mm , 0.1”) for the screen to plug into (you can very carefully cut down a large socket, as I did, now I have real ones!)
