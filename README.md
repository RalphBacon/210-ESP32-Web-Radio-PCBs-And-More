The year 2020 has definitely been different to that expected so let's tidy up a few loose ends:  
* A clarification to the Timer video from last week (#209)
* Not 1, not 2 but 4 PCBs to look at from the wonderful JLCPCB  
* A quick mention of Norman Dunbar's excellent Arduino Software Internals book.  

And other stuff that I mention along the way!
