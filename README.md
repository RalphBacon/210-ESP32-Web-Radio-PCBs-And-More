### See YouTube video #210 at www.youtube.com/ralphbacon or directly here:   

The year 2020 has definitely been different to that expected so let's today up a few loose ends:  
* A clarification to the Timer video from last week (#209)
* Not 1, not 2 but 4 PCBs to look at from the wonderful JLCPCB  
* A quick mention of Norman Dunbar's excellent Arduino Software Internals book.  

And other stuff that I mention along the way!
